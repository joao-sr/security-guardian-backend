# Guardian

The **Guardian API** is a secure and scalable API solution built with **ASP.NET Core**. The project tries to have a sort of template solution to implement authentication via JWT tokens on the backend services to be integrated with any generic front end.
It provides user authentication using **JWT tokens**, role-based access control, and CRUD operations for managing resources. Designed with **Clean Architecture**, it ensures separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. Ideal for modern web and mobile applications.
This repository will serve as a guide to build future projects as well as a knowledge reference.

## Features

- **Backend**: RESTful API for user registration, login, and authentication.   
- **Security**: Encrypted passwords, JWT for session management, and role-based access control.  
- **Tech Stack**: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ASP.NET Core Identity. 
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, Git, Swager/OpenAPI

## Clean Architecture

The Guardian API follows **Clean Architecture**, a design pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns and maintainability. It organizes the project into layers:
- **Domain**: Contains entities.
- **Application**: Contains the contracts for the repositories and services.
- **Infrastructure**: Handles data access, external services and service implementation.
- **API**: Exposes endpoints for client interaction.

This structure ensures that the core business logic remains independent of frameworks, databases, and UI, making the application more testable, scalable, and adaptable to change.
